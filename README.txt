=== casheww's RegionCast ===

Rain World RegionCast is a BepInEx mod written by casheww that enables Discord Rich Presence for Rain World, allowing players to snoop on each others current region and adds the region landscape art as Rich Presence assets.

This mod was built for BepInEx so it probably won't work with standard Partiality.

The IMPORTANT bit:
  1) Place the DiscordGameSDK folder in the same place as your "Rain World.exe"
  2) Place RegionCast.dll in BepInEx/plugins (it is a mod)
