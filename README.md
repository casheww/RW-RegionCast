## casheww's RegionCast

Rain World RegionCast is a BepInEx mod written by casheww that enables Discord Rich Presence for Rain World, allowing players to snoop on each others current region and adds the region landscape art as Rich Presence assets.

This mod was built for BepInEx so it probably won't work with standard Partiality, though I don't think it uses anything BepInEx reliant, so it *could* be modified for Partiality.

For anyone looking to modify the source code, the Setter code is from a .NET Core console app project, and the Trigger is from a .NET Framework 3.5 class library.

### The IMPORTANT bit:
[Download](https://github.com/casheww/RW-RegionCast/releases/tag/v0.1)
  1) Place the `DiscordGameSDK` folder in the same place as your `Rain World.exe`
  2) Place `RegionCast.dll` in `BepInEx/plugins` (it is a mod)

Please contact casheww#7881 in the Rain World Discord if you have any difficulties <3
