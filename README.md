PLEASE SCROLL DOWN FOR INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

---

### Features
Displays the following game details on your Discord profile for other users to see while you play
- region thumbnail art
- region/arena name
- game mode / difficulty
- time spent in current game mode


### Installation
`.` in file paths represents the Rain World root directory.

1) You must have Rain World BepInEx installed and set up - this won't run on Partiality.   [BepInEx download](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1WcCCsS3ABBdO1aX-iJGeqeE07YE4Qv88/view) | [Rain World Discord](https://discord.gg/rainworld)
2) Download the first .zip from the first "Assets" dropdown from [here](https://github.com/casheww/RW-RegionCast/releases/)
3) Extract `RegionCast.dll` to `./BepInEx/plugins`
4) Extract the entire `RegionCast-DiscordGameSDK` folder to the Rain World root directory

It should go without saying that Discord needs to be running on the same machine for this to work.

Any issues? You can reach me on the [Rain World Discord](https://discord.gg/rainworld) @casheww#7881.
